# Practice Node.js

Welcome to my personal Node.js practice repository! This repository contains various small Node.js projects and exercises that I've worked on to improve my skills and explore different Node.js concepts.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured into various directories, each representing distinct Node.js projects or exercises:

-  A simple note-taking app
-  A weather application leveraging openweathermap.org and geocode.maps.co APIs.

## About the Course

I've put together this GitHub repository while taking "The Complete Node.js Developer Course." This course covers everything from the basics to advanced topics like building APIs and working with databases.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project:

Navigate to the desired project directory.

1. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. Create a `.env` file and include the following variables:

-  GEOCODE_KEY: Your API key for geocoding services.
-  WEATHER_KEY: Your API key for weather services.

3. Run `npm run devStart` to start the programs
